# Professional Registration Form

This is a modern, minimal React application for a professional registration form, built with Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- **React 18 + TypeScript**: Fast, type-safe, and modern frontend stack.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development.
- **Form Validation**: Real-time validation for all fields (name, email, phone, location, date, and time slot).
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
